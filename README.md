# Canurta & The Healing Project 

## Overview

The Healing Project is a groundbreaking initiative by Canurta Inc., merging cutting-edge science, storytelling, and blockchain technology to fight chronic diseases, starting with ALS. While the project initially paused in late 2023 due to market conditions, our commitment to innovation, impact, and creativity never wavered. This repository details our journey, achievements, and our path forward as we reignite The Healing Project and continue to tell our story in the decentralized world.

## Our Journey Since 2023

In late 2023, as the NFT market faced turbulence, Canurta shifted its focus to its core mission: creating real-world impact. After reviewing our pipeline, we spent 2024 narrowing our focus; we chose **CNR-401**, a hemp-derived anti-inflammatory asset, as our priority. Here's how far we've come since then:
- **Scalability and Impact**: CNR-401 showed immense promise for large-scale production and the potential to transform the lives of ALS patients.
- **Regulatory Milestones**: We are now FDA-ready for a Pre-IND meeting and targeting IND submission in 2025.
- **Global Trials**: Plans for Phase 2 clinical trials are underway in Australia, the UK, and Canada.
- **Continued Creativity**: Despite the pivot, we never abandoned our creative roots. The Xilas Syndicate and The Healing Project remain integral to our vision, blending storytelling and science to drive community-driven research and innovation.

## Reigniting the Xilas Syndicate - 2025 and Beyond

The Xilas Syndicate represents our narrative arm, a sci-fi mythos where our heroes battle the metaphors of chronic diseases. With the Orb of Healing now on Earth, our first hero, **Zyla**, emerges to fight two initial foes:

- **Mnemoros**: A shadowy manipulator who erodes memory and coordination, symbolizing the cognitive struggles of ALS.
- **Atroxys**: A paralyzing force who binds her victims in invisible chains, representing physical immobility.

### Meet Zyla: The Voice of the Mission
Minted by our CEO, Zyla is more than a hero; she's a decentralized storyteller, infused with GenAI capabilities to carry forward our mission. Zyla invites our community to join her in defeating Mnemoros and Atroxys while Canurta battles ALS through clinical trials. Her life's mission is to wield the Orb of Healing, empowering humanity and restoring balance.

## Our Vision: Innovation, Decentralization, and Community

The Healing Project blends decentralized innovation with collective storytelling to inspire and engage:
- **Clinical and Creative Integration**: Every time we advance an asset to the clinic, a new hero's story is born to symbolize the battle against another systemic disease.
- **Learning and Storytelling**: Innovative ways to educate and connect communities through sci-fi narratives, gaming, and storytelling.
- **Community Involvement**: We can't do this alone. Join us in shaping campaigns, suggesting new challenges, and expanding the Syndicate's lore.

## How You Can Help

1. **Collaborate**: Contribute to our spec scripts, suggest campaigns, or propose new villains (diseases) for our heroes to fight.
2. **Engage**: Share feedback, spread our story, and help bring awareness to ALS and other diseases.
3. **Innovate**: Suggest creative opportunities, technologies, or partnerships to advance our mission.
